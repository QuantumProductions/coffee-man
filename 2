The bar's stayed full and a queue has formed behind me. I take a seat at the end as the previous patron leaves, my fingers drumming a little pattern in 7/4 time I discovered watching the rain fall this morning.

With the barista busy, my mind makes a stacatto leap from the pattern, to the crowd to the pattern of last night.

[I attended a concert. / I played in the street.]

I smile in memory of the second act with a nod at the barista who begins my usual with precision. Quite a show -- I haven't seen a lead guitarist with those string modifications before. I danced furiously and ended up with a partner on the floor. She slept in bed when I woke up this morning, a pleasant encore to the evening jam. 

I'm mildly curious to see if she's interested in continuing our pattern, but now the warmth of steam tendrils dancing through my nostrils brings me to my moment of awakening.

--

Little rhythms, pouring down my mind from heaven. Fingers dancing across the strings, twisting and shaking the world around me. A small crowd embraced my sonic fountain and I played as though a new universe formed in the hollowness of my guitar with each instinctive strum.

Even took a beautiful fan home with me. She slept in bed when I woke up this morning, a pleasant encore to the evening jam. 

I'm mildly curious to see if she's interested in continuing our pattern, but now the warmth of steam tendrils dancing through my nostrils brings me to my moment of awakening.
