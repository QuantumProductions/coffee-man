The throbbing in my head has only increased since awakening. I stumbled down the roads into my favorite coffee shop, asking myself if these late nights still held their value. Doesn't look too crowded from the outside but a few loud talkers competing with each other for airspace drive aural painwaves through my skull.

I sit as far away from the talkers as possible, cringing as a pair walks up to the cashier to order a second round. I lift my hand slightly to wave at my favorite barista. His smile turns into a grimace seeing my hungover frustration. He finishes taking the loud talker's order and promises to bring their conversation fuel to their table. They walk past me, chattering about turn radii in their new cars.

The barista begins pouring my coffee before theirs - straight black from the faucet of hangover mediation.

I sip gently as the awareness winds through my face, heating my internal mind.

Ah.. so much better now. I strum the book I brought in as my eyes catch sight of sunlight outside.

[I sip slowly and read. | I quaff quickly and walk.] 

Drinking & reading, the perfect recovery for hungover coffee man. I open my book, find my place and begin devouring the letters. Mesmerized by the words on the page my internal mind swallows their meaning with a warm sip of coffee. I drink the language of my race and never feel full.

The coffee has replenished my movements. Little rhythmic twitches ride through my limbs as my internal mind awakens to its musical memory.

I tip my barista extra and stride ambitiously towards the door. Waking up and moving freely in the morning, I once again feel control.
