My barista smiles at me from his sky-blue ceramic mug as I walk in the door. Cinnamon wafts from his mug down the bar. Tainted by the perfumes and sweats of his customers, the flavor drives my memory to a race three winters ago.

I take a seat across from him and his smile morphs into a slight frown. He has my order ready and slides it in front of me -- must have read it in my face. "Saw a hitchhiker today", he says. "Walking South. Why I couldn't reckon, since that place fell into sharp pieces, social fabric fractured by competing desires and dangerous economic weapons."

"You speak of the shootings."

"All violence arises from economics, Coffee Man. Generally the economics of scarcity. Now I wondered, why would anyone hitchhike down there?"

[I hitchiked once. / Will you pick them up on your way back out?]

I hitchhiked once -- down in Taos. Freezing cold outside, snow glazing down highway. I had missed a bus, see, it only stopped for a moment.. I had only the name of a band to go by, and I set out in the cold in search of a house party."

My barista takes a slow sip from his cinnamon memory mug. He's waited a good minute since I told a story.

"Walked and walked and walked. Took down the last protein bar in my pocket.  Had a rough map in my head from directions given to me 7 hours earlier but.. out in the cold, everywhere leads to nowhere.I ended up in a stranger's home, after thinking I had found my destiniation. Kind girl, shared -- well, insisted on sharing -- a shot with me to wamr me ufp"
