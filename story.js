["I spot my friend by his green and white plaid shirt stained with matching paint resting over his relaxed slouch at the bar. He sips a mocha latte out of a ocean blue ceramic mug and I smile, happy to see familiar signs. I hang my coat on the chair, order the daily roast and slide into the chair next to him.",

["'Hey buddy. I found a dog today. Healthy looking pup, just looked a little lost off 13th.'",
[["Coffee", 2]]],

["'Oh yah? My daughter's asked me for a dog. Hard enough for her to find playmates since her...'",

["Black life winds out of its bowl, dripping into my mug. From Venezuela, dark with a hint of citrus. It smells like ambition and lifts me out of my haze.",

["'Give the dog to your child. He ran away - let him meet a new friend.'\n\n'Thanks, coffee man. Come by tonight?'\n\n'Always nice to see your family. I'll bring her new pal.'",

["I turn to face the voice, a woman lifting her wide-brimmed hat the shade of my friend's mug to look questioningly into my eyes.",
[["Coffee", 9]]],

["'That's yours? Glad you found me. Please sit, share a drink with us. I'll walk your dog here after.'",
[["Coffee", 10]]],

["She smiles, sits next to me, orders an expresso then turns to face me.",

["'I thought he got lost when he ran out this morning. Patching up the walls after the storm spooked him. He's a simple creature, but he keeps me happy.'",
