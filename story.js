He sips a mocha latte out of a ocean blue ceramic mug and I smile, happy to see familiar signs. I hang my coat on the chair, order the daily roast and slide into the chair next to him. \n\n 'Hey buddy. I found a dog today. Healthy looking pup, just looked a little lost off 13th.' \n\n'Oh yah? My daughter has asked me for a dog. Hard enough for her to find playmates since her... '",

It smells like ambition and lifts me out of my haze. \n\n'Give the dog to your child. He ran away - let him meet a new friend.' \n\n'Thanks, coffee man. Come by tonight?' \n\n 'Always nice to see your family. I'll bring her new pal.' \n\nI sip from Venezuela's roast and imagine what else I can transform today."],

I heard you found a puppy -- off 13th? Sort of beige with white spots?' \n\nI turn to face the voice, a woman lifting her wide-brimmed hat the shade of my friend's mug to look questioningly into my eyes. \n\n 'That's yours? Glad you found me. Please sit, share a drink with us. I'll walk your dog here after.' \n\nShe smiles and sits next to me, orders an expresso. 'I thought he got lost when he ran out this morning. Patching up the walls after the storm spooked him. He's a simple creature, but he keeps me happy.'\n\nI sip from Venezuela's roast and imagine losing myself in the city."]]
