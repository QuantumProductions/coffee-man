I spot my friend by his green and white plaid shirt stained with paint resting over his relaxed slouch at the bar. He's sipping a mocha latte out of a ocean blue ceramic mug and I smile, happy to see familiar signs. I hang my coat on the chair, order the daily roast and slide into the chair next to him.

"Hey buddy. I found a dog today. Healthy looking pup, just looked a little lost off 13th."

"Oh yah? My daughter's been wanting a dog. Hard enough for her to find playmates since her... "

[Give Dog? / Think about it]

Black life winds out of its bowl, dripping into my mug. From Venezuela, dark with a hint of citrus. It smells like ambition and lifts me out of my haze.

"Give the dog to your child. It ran away - let it meet a new friend."
"Thanks, coffee man. Come by tonight?"
"Always nice to see your family. I'll bring her new friend."

I sip from Venezuela's roast and imagine what else I can transform today.

--

Memories of ernest harvest and a striving for peace glide from the smooth roast over my pallete as a gentle tap returns me to my seat.

"Excuse me, sir? I heard you found a puppy -- off 13th? Sort of beige with white spots?"

I turn to face the voice, a woman lifting her wide-brimmed hat the shade of my friend's mug to look questioningly into my eyes.

"That's yours? Glad you found me. Can you sit, share a drink with us. I'll walk your dog here after."

She smiles and sits next to me, orders an expresso.

"I thought he got lost when he ran out this morning. Patching up the walls after the storm spooked him. He's a simple creature, but he keeps me happy."

I sip from Venezuela's roast and imagine losing myself in the city.
