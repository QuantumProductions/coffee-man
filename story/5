The muffins up front looked delicious -- I grabbed one of the pumpkin walnut stock before easing into the bar seat. 

My barista faces the rear drip machine, smiles at my reflection in its sheen. He finishes drying a black mug speckled with silver points, centers it under the faucet and starts a drip.

"Hey Coffee Man, how's the dating?"
["Still a pleasant surprise." / "We're seeing each other slowly."]

"I never expected to meet someone with similar interests in rhythm and groove. Hoped, yes.."

"Ah Coffee Man, I like seeing you smile. When will you see her next?"

He sips from his drip coffee with practiced muscle memory as his spare hand centers another mug in exactly the same position for another drip from the faucet of awakening.

"Move night tonight. Impromptu -- her idea."

He nods and I bite into my muffin. Delicious, filling, and nutritious. I can only hope my new relationship will prove as excellent quality as this muffin. I'll put the work in -- but it takes two to tango..

"Relationships, Coffee Man, are like a dance -- there are no rules. You have to figure out what makes you both happy and you have only yourselves to figure it out."

I wash a baked pumpkin & walnut composition down with a sip of fresh drip coffee from Venezuela. The sound of footsteps trickle through my nostrils.

My barista swirls his mug from hand to hand, black drip coffee twirling towards the rim. He lifts to his lips, downs the rest and smiles.

"Enjoy while it's hot."

How can we keep this going with our own internal heat?
